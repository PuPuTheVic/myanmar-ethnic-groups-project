                  <p>
                    The Kayah (or Karenni/Red Karen) people are thought to have migrated into their current homeland, Kayah State in eastern Myanmar, 
                    from Central Asia, possibly from Tibet or Mongolia, around the first millennium BCE. They are a sub-group of the larger Karen people, 
                    inhabiting the isolated mountainous border region with Thailand. Their recorded history in the region is limited, but the traditional 
                    rulers of the Karenni states, the Saophyas or Sawbwas, maintained significant independence from neighboring Burman and Thai powers until 
                    the late 19th century when British colonial authorities began integrating them into the administration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Kayah people, also known as Karenni, are a Sino-Tibetan group residing in the isolated mountain regions of Kayah 
                    State, Myanmar. There isn't a historical "Kingdom" of Kayah people, but rather the collective term "Karenni" refers to 
                    the nine native ethnic groups within Kayah State, including the Kayah themselves, the Kayaw, and the Kayan (Padaung).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Key historical figures for the Kayah (Karenni) people include U Bee Htu Re, a resistance leader who fought against the 
                    Bamar government in 1948, and figures involved in the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), which was formed to fight for self-determination.

                  <ul>
                    <li>Traditional Dress: The Kayah traditional dress is known for its bright, red colors and distinctive features, with 
                      women often wearing sleeveless black blouses, red cloaks, long white shawls, and a longyi (sarong-like garment) in red or black, 
                      while men wear white headdresses, shirts, and trousers. Kayah clothing is also notable for its intricately woven textiles, colorful turbans, 
                      and silver accessories like earrings and bracelets, which convey cultural identity and social status.</li>
                    <li>Music & Dance: The music and dance of the Kayah people are integral to their cultural events, such as the Kay-Htoe-Boe festival, 
                      where they perform traditional dances and use instruments like the frog drum and bamboo guitar. Dances often feature group movements, 
                      such as the shield dance and stepping between moving bamboo poles, and are central to festivals that symbolize prosperity and unity.</li>
                    <li>Festivals: The main festival of the Kayah (Karenni) people is the Kay Htoe Boe Festival, also known as the Sacred Totem Pole Festival, 
                      celebrated annually in April. Other notable events include the Frog Drum Festival and traditional dances like the Tagundaing and house-warming ceremonies. 
                      These festivals involve selecting and erecting a sacred totem pole, offering prayers for prosperity and good harvest, and participating in ethnic dance and costume competitions.</li>
                    <li>Arts & Crafts: The Kayah people's arts and crafts include distinctive textiles woven on backstrap looms, with women creating vibrant 
                      cotton costumes and intricate braids, and traditional laquered cotton products used for various items. Artisans also repurpose materials, 
                      making baskets and even jewelry from discarded items like tin cooking pots. These crafts are often tied to cultural practices and serve as a means of income for communities, as seen in Pan Pet village.</li>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Kayah (Karenni) people were traditionally animists, believing in spirits and nature, but many have since converted to Christianity
                    and Buddhism. Their animistic traditions include venerating spirits through the Kay Htoe Boe festival, which features poles and chicken bone divination to predict the future 
                    and ensure blessings. Other aspects include animal sacrifice to spirits and offering bones to guard the environment, with some villages still holding these animistic rituals today, often alongside Christian or Buddhist practices.

                      such as hand-weaving clothes and crafting bamboo items, and have recently been involved in community-based tourism.</li>
                    <li>Housing: Kayah people's traditional housing is built with natural materials like bamboo and thatch and often stands on stilts 
                      to protect against the elements and provide a cooler living space. While detailed specific house styles are limited, the general 
                      construction reflects their agricultural lifestyle, with villages often located in clearings within forested areas.</li>
                    <li>Role in Myanmar’s economy: The Kayah people's role in Myanmar's economy is primarily agricultural, with livelihoods based on cultivating

                  <p>The historical contributions of the Kayah (Karenni) people include preserving rich cultural traditions, contributing to 
                    the region's economy through agriculture and natural resources like marble and teak, and providing significant energy production 
                    through the Lawpita hydroelectric plant, though often without direct local benefit. They also played a role in supporting troops 
                    during wartime by preparing food for soldiers and have recently begun a tentative engagement with tourism to share their culture with the world.</p>
                  <p>While there is limited readily available information on famous writers explicitly identified as "Kayah," a notable figure from 
                    a Kayah community is Pascal Khoo Thwe, an author from the Kayan Padaung ethnic group, known for his award-winning autobiography, 
                    "From the Land of the Green Ghosts, A Burmese Odyssey". His work provides insight into Kayan customs and life during civil war, and 
                    he is a key advocate for preserving Kayan culture.</p>
