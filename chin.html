                      Writing systems vary: many Chin languages today use the Latin alphabet, while some also adapt Myanmar script.</li>

                  <h2 class="display-6 mb-3">History & Background</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Chin peoples are part of the larger Tibeto-Burman (Sino-Tibetan) ethnolinguistic family. 
                    Oral traditions and historical research suggest that they migrated from the upper regions of Tibet and China, gradually moving southward into present-day Myanmar, northeastern India, and Bangladesh over many centuries. 
                    Their settlement in the mountainous Chin Hills gave them a distinct identity, shaped by geography and relative isolation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Chin did not form a single large kingdom but were organized in clan-based chiefdoms. Each village or group of villages was often governed by local chiefs (hereditary or elected), 
                    known for their authority in war, land distribution, and social rituals. During the pre-colonial period, they maintained autonomy but also engaged in trade and conflict with neighboring groups such as the Arakanese (Rakhine), Burmese, and Indian hill tribes. 
                    Under British colonial rule (late 19th century), the Chin Hills were annexed and administered separately as the Chin Hills District.

                      stripes, and intricate patterns. Each subgroup has its own unique style. For example, 
                      Lai/Hakha women wear long woven skirts (puan) with bold red and black designs, while Falam and Tedim have different weaving patterns. 
                      Traditional shawls and tunics are worn during festivals, weddings, and ceremonies.</li>
                    <li>Music & Dance: Chin music traditionally uses instruments such as the Khuang (drum), gongs, and bamboo flutes. 
                      Group dances are performed during festivals, often involving circular movements and chanting. 
                      Christian hymns and modern instruments have also become a major part of Chin music after missionary influence.</li>
                    <li>

                        <li>Christmas and Easter: Widely celebrated due to the majority Christian population.</li>
                        <li>Traditional Animist Festivals: In some areas, rituals to honor spirits (nat) are still observed.</li>

                    <li>Cuisines: Chin food is simple but hearty, often based on rice, millet, corn, beans, meat, and leafy vegetables.

                  <p>
                    The majority of Chin people are Christians (mostly Baptist, some Catholic and other denominations). 
                    Christianity spread widely after American missionaries arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, church life plays a central role in Chin communities, influencing education, music, festivals, and social values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before Christianity, most Chin subgroups practiced Animism, believing in spirits (known as Hnam or Khoi) that influenced health, crops, and daily life. 
                    Ritual animal sacrifices (such as pigs, chickens, mithun) were made to appease spirits or ensure good harvests. Some animist practices still survive in remote villages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In some areas, traditional beliefs and Christianity have blended—families may follow Christian practices while still respecting ancestral rituals or symbolic traditions.

                    <li>Main livelihoods: Subsistence agriculture, especially shifting cultivation (slash-and-burn farming). 
                      Common crops include rice, maize, millet, beans, sesame, and vegetables. Livestock such as pigs, chickens, and mithun (a type of cattle) are also important. 
                      In some areas, people engage in weaving, hunting, and small-scale trade.</li>
                    <li>Housing: Chin villages are usually located on hilltops or mountain slopes. Traditional houses are built from wood and bamboo, 
                      with thatched or tin roofs. In highland areas, houses are often raised on stilts to protect from rain and animals.</li>
                    <li>Role in Myanmar’s economy: Chin State is one of the least developed regions in Myanmar due to poor infrastructure and remoteness. 
                      However, the Chin contribute through agriculture, weaving crafts, and cross-border trade with India and Bangladesh. 
                      Chin textiles are highly valued as cultural products, and many Chin migrants also send remittances back home, supporting the local economy.</li>

                    <li>Historical Contributions: The Chin played a significant role in Myanmar’s political history. 
                      During the colonial period, many Chin served in the military and administration under the British. 
                      After independence, Chin leaders participated in the Panglong Agreement of 1947, which was crucial for the founding of the Union of Burma.</li>
                    <li>Unique Heritage: In the past, some Chin women practiced facial tattooing as a cultural tradition. 
                      Each subgroup had distinct patterns, symbolizing beauty, identity, and cultural pride. Though the practice has largely disappeared, it remains a unique marker of Chin heritage and identity.</li>
